# sportsstock_db_design

This was my final project for my database class during my MS program in Information Systems at Drexel.  For the project I designed a databse for a fictional application that would allow live propositional betting on sports events.  It is similar to what eventually turned into Fan Duel but my idea was that users could buy/sell any propositional contract not just fixed propositions on specific players.  

An ERD has been created for a 3NF normalized database and implementated via DDL statements.  Common tasks and queries have been tested and are stored within the respective DML and query SQL files.  The SQL files are meant to mimic an application using this database.  For further detail of the project please refer to the PD which contains the ER model, Data Dictionaries, DDL, DML, and recurring queries.
